# Perform-exploratory-data-analysis-on
-retail-data-with-Python

Summary
In this exploratory data analysis project for an online retail store, I utilized Python and key data analysis libraries including Pandas Matplotlib to derive business insights from transactional data

Solution
 

In this project, I achieved the objectives by conducting a thorough exploratory data analysis on the retail dataset using Python. I first cleaned the data by removing missing CustomerID entries and then explored sales trends over time. I identified December as the busiest month and Thursday as the highest sales day. I analyzed top-selling products, with World War 2 Gliders leading, and found the United Kingdom as the top market.


Approach
 Here’s how I got the project done, step by step:

Data Cleanup: I loaded the dataset and removed missing entries. 

Exploring the Goods: I dove into the data, looking at stats and converting dates so I could figure out sales

Making it Pretty: I whipped up some cool visuals—line plots and bar plots

Recommendations: Gave tips on marketing, stocking, and boosting sales in underperforming countries.

Findings: Spotted the top products  and countries.
